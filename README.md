# EmitterBasicCircuitCalculator
Use this tool to calculate precise values for your Basic Emitter Circuit (Simple Amplifier)

Usage:
- After running the program, fill the variables with values you either have been provided by the manufacturer or which are attached to your component datasheets.
- The program will ask you to choose a decimal index.
- After returning the sought values, the program will end.

Key:

 - Is: Nominal Current [Ampere]
 - B: Transistor Coefficient (B0 = B)
 - Rc: Resistance of Collector Resistor [Ohm]
 - Ub: Circuit Base Voltage [Volt]
 - Ir2/Ib: Ratio between R2 and Base Current
 - Ut: Transistor Temperature Voltage [Volt]
 - Uout: Output (amplified) voltage [Volt]
 - Ic: Current through Rc Resistor [Ampere]
 - Ib: Base Current [Ampere]
 - Ir2: Current through R2 Reistor [Ampere]
 - Ube: Voltage over Base and Emitter [Volt]
 - R2: Reistance of second Resistor [Ohm]
 - Ur1: Voltage over R1 Resistor [Volt]
 - Ir1: Current through R1 Resistor [Ampere]
 - R1: Resistance of first Resistor [Ohm]

This project will remain as V1 and will neither be updated nor rewritten.

Thank you for leaving feedback and using this tool.
